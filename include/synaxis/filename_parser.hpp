// Result of parsing a single media filename. Fields are nullopt/empty when
// no recognized pattern is found. Resolution/codec are intentionally not
// handled here — those are properties of the encoded stream and get
// inspected via libmpv instead. Source (WEB-DL/BluRay/HDTV/CAM/HDTS/...) and
// edition tags (PROPER/REPACK/IMAX/HDR/AMZN/NF/...) describe how the file
// was ripped or released, which isn't recoverable from the stream itself,
// so they have to come from the filename like season/episode. `title` is a
// fallback series/movie name derived from the filename itself, for when the
// user doesn't supply one; `year` (movies) doubles as the signal that lets
// `title` know where to stop when there's no season/episode marker.
